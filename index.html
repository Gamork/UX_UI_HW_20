        <p class="lead">For this group porject we were challanged to create an app from scratch. We decided an app to  help pet owners by digitally sharing, tracking, and assigning, the daily task and responsibilities of pet ownership with other caretakers.

        <P>Problem Statment</P>
        <p>Maintaining a healthy balance for pet owners can be a constant struggle. Family demands, career requirements, and busy social lives can keep us from a regular schedule. Taking the time for pet care is well worth the effort. Balancing care for our companions can increase our opportunities to get out and exercise to keep the whole household healthy.   Keeping the family uptodate on pet responsibilities can be a challenge with our busy lives. My Pet Pal will help with this coordination of tasks by keeping everyone in the loop with notifications of their assigned responsibilities.  Keeping your pets perky and poised for play time.

            <div class="col">The research interviews were conducted with the help of Zoom software.  A group effort was put into creating a list of questions for the interviews.  The focus on different aspects of pet ownership to allow the interviewees to open up with a mixture of questions concerning daily pet requirements. Play, feeding, restroom, and other responsibilities were the focus of these questions. A trend all of the interviewees mentioned was being on a schedule. Also having to keep track of the schedule while sharing it with others. To assist pet owners with scheduling several products exist already. Physical boards with manual switches lettered with done/ not done is an option that got high reviews websites but did not assist in the daily tracking of pets when you are away or for keeping younger family members accountable while away.  Another option is an app. It was able to allow the user to put in a daily reminder notification for tasks. It was only able to be used on one phone, it was not shareable, and did not have a way to know if the task was completed with a tracking graph.</div>

This was confirmed while doing the Feature Prioritization Matrix.
                    Our user interviews informed us that pet owners want to keep track of tasks to complete, when to complete them, whether they were completed, and who will finish them. For this reason, our users will need to add tasks to a calendar, view them, assign them, and mark them complete. The user flow has options to assign a user to a task, add info about the task, and after having created a task, the user can view the task in a list.

Our tests on the prototype were done using Zoom.  We then synthesized some of the feedback we received and placed it on a Miro board to organize our plan. Similar responses were combined and a color was assigned to them.  Dark green were stated frequently and minilla less so.

During this testing process we received feedback that “it would be nice to have favorites saved so we don't have to type it in each time.”  From that we added a drop down with previous locations to assist in choosing a location.
